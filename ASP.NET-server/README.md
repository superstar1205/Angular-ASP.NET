# ProductStore

ASP.NET Web API application to perform CRUD Operations. CRUD stands for "Create, Read, Update, and Delete," which are the four basic database operations. Many HTTP services also model CRUD operations through REST or REST-like APIs. This project has been created so that it can be used as a backend API for Azure API Management troubleshooting scenarios documented over here. The development of this Web API solution was inspired from this OneCode sample : https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ASP-NET-Web-API-Tutorial-c4761894
